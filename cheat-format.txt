Below is a short description of the FB Alpha cheat file format. Cheat files
must be placed in the cheats subdirectory, and named according to the sort
name/name of the zip file containing the ROMs, with the extension being
either .dat or .ini (e.g. 1941.zip becomes 1941.dat or 1941.ini). FBA will
present a warning and some additional info whenever it encounters an error
in a cheat file, and will stop processing the file at that point.


Cheat file format

cheat "cheatname" {	// New cheat called "cheatname" (the curly bracket is
			// optional)

			// type 0 = apply each frame, save original value and
			//	    remain active;
			//      1 = one-shot, fire and forget;
			//      2 = one-shot, save original value and remain
			//	    active

			// is disabled

    n "name", o, p, q	// Add option n (1 <= n <= 95), called "name"
                        // Store byte value q at address p in the address
                        // space of CPU o
                        // Only 68K CPUs are supported, you can specify upto
                        // 32 o/p/q groups per option, all must be on the
                        // same line.
